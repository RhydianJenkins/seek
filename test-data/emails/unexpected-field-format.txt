Subject: URGENT: Date format changed breaking our integration

Support Team,

Our production integration broke this morning. The API is now returning dates in a different format than before.

Previously: "2024-02-18T11:07:29Z"
Now: "2024-02-18T11:07:29.123Z"

Our date parser doesn't handle milliseconds and we're getting errors across the system. This is affecting thousands of users.

Was this an intentional API change? We didn't receive any deprecation notice.

Hi Lisa,

I apologize for the disruption. We deployed a backend update this morning that standardized timestamp precision across all endpoints. This should have been backwards compatible as both formats are valid ISO 8601.

However, I understand this is breaking your integration. As an immediate workaround, you can add the header "X-API-Version: 2023-12" to your requests to get the old format while you update your parser.

We'll also update our changelog to reflect this change more clearly.

Priority escalated to our engineering team.

Carlos,

The X-API-Version header worked, thank you. That gives us breathing room.

However, I want to emphasize that breaking changes like this need better communication. Even if it's "technically" backwards compatible, real-world integrations have constraints.

Can you share your API versioning and deprecation policy?

Lisa

Hi Lisa,

You're absolutely right, and I've passed your feedback to our product team. We're implementing a new policy:

1. All format changes will be announced 30 days in advance
2. Breaking changes will only happen during major version updates
3. We'll maintain version headers for 12 months after deprecation

I've added your email to our API changelog distribution list. You'll receive advance notice of all future changes.

Again, sorry for the disruption.

Carlos
