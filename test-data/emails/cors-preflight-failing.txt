Subject: CORS preflight requests failing from browser

Hello,

We're building a single-page app that calls your API directly from the browser, but we're getting CORS errors on all requests:

"Access to fetch at 'https://api.cloudplatform.io/v1/data' from origin 'https://app.webapp.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check"

We've added our domain to the CORS whitelist in the dashboard settings. What else do we need to configure?

Hi Alex,

I see your domain in the CORS configuration. The issue is that you're sending custom headers that require additional CORS setup.

Your requests include: "X-API-Key" and "X-Request-ID"

You need to add these to "Allowed Headers" in your CORS settings:
Dashboard → Settings → API → CORS Configuration → Allowed Headers

By default, only standard headers (Authorization, Content-Type) are permitted.

Let me know if you need help finding this setting.

Nina,

Found it! I added both headers and now it's working.

Quick follow-up: Is it safe to call your API directly from the browser, or should we proxy through our backend? We're concerned about exposing our API key.

Hi Alex,

Great question. For production, we strongly recommend proxying through your backend. Here's why:

1. API keys in browser code can be extracted by users
2. You can't enforce rate limiting per user (all requests share one key)
3. Users can see all API request details

Best practice: Use your backend to authenticate users, then have it make API calls with your secure key.

Alternatively, check out our "Public API Keys" feature (Beta) which creates restricted, domain-locked keys safe for browser use.

Best,
Nina
