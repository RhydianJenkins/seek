Subject: API Authentication Tokens Expiring Too Quickly

Hi Support Team,

We're experiencing issues with our integration where API tokens seem to be expiring much faster than the documented 24-hour lifetime. Our application is receiving 401 errors approximately every 2-3 hours, forcing us to re-authenticate constantly.

This is causing disruption to our automated workflows. Could you please investigate?

Thanks,
Sarah Jenkins
Senior Developer, Acme Corp

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out. I've reviewed your account's API usage logs. The token expiry is actually working as designed, but I notice you're using the "Standard" tier tokens which have a 3-hour lifetime, not 24 hours.

The 24-hour lifetime is available on our "Professional" tier and above. Would you like information about upgrading your plan?

Best regards,
Marcus Chen
Support Engineer

Hi Marcus,

That explains it - our documentation must be outdated. For now, we'll adjust our refresh logic to handle 3-hour expiry. I'll discuss the upgrade with our team.

One follow-up: is there a specific error code we should watch for to detect token expiry vs other auth failures?

Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Yes! Token expiry returns a 401 with error code "TOKEN_EXPIRED". Invalid tokens return "INVALID_TOKEN" and insufficient permissions return "FORBIDDEN".

Check the "X-Error-Code" header in the response for the specific code.

Best,
Marcus
