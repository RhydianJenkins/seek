Subject: Bulk import endpoint timing out

Hi Support,

We're trying to import 5,000 customer records using POST /api/v1/customers/bulk but the request times out after 30 seconds. We're only getting about 800 records imported before the timeout.

Is there a limit we're hitting? Our payload is valid JSON (we tested with smaller batches).

Hi Maria,

The bulk import endpoint has a 30-second timeout and a recommended batch size of 1,000 records. For 5,000 records, you should split into 5 separate requests.

However, we have a better solution: our asynchronous bulk import API.

POST /api/v1/customers/bulk/async

This accepts up to 50,000 records, returns immediately with a job ID, and you poll for completion:

GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}

Would you like example code for this approach?

Best,

Andrew,

Yes, please! The async approach sounds much better. How long do jobs typically take, and is there a webhook option instead of polling?

Hi Maria,

Processing time varies: roughly 1 second per 100 records, so ~50 seconds for 5,000 records.

Yes, webhooks are supported! When creating the async job, include a callback URL:

```json
POST /api/v1/customers/bulk/async
{
  "records": [...],
  "webhook_url": "https://importer.com/callbacks/import-complete"
}
```

You'll receive a POST to your webhook when the job completes (or fails) with the full job results.

Example response:
```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "total": 5000,
  "successful": 4998,
  "failed": 2,
  "errors": [...]
}
```

Best,
Andrew
