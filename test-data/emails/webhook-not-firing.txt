Subject: Webhooks not triggering for user.created events

Hello,

We set up a webhook endpoint last week to receive user.created events, but we're not receiving any notifications even though we can see new users being created through the dashboard.

Our endpoint: https://api.techstartup.io/webhooks/cloudplatform
Event subscription: user.created

Can you help troubleshoot this?

Hi David,

I've checked your webhook configuration and I can see the issue. Our system has been trying to deliver events to your endpoint, but we're receiving SSL certificate errors (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID).

Your endpoint is using a certificate for "*.techstartup.com" but the webhook URL uses "techstartup.io" domain. The domain mismatch is causing our delivery system to reject the connection.

Could you either update the endpoint URL or fix the SSL certificate?

Best,

Jennifer,

Good catch! I've updated the webhook URL to https://api.techstartup.com/webhooks/cloudplatform

Can you retry the delivery or do I need to recreate the webhook?

Hi David,

No need to recreate! I've manually triggered a test event and it delivered successfully. Your webhook is now active and you should start receiving events normally.

Note: We don't automatically retry events that failed during the configuration phase, so you won't receive notifications for users created between Feb 3-4.

Best,
Jennifer
