Subject: OAuth flow failing with redirect_uri_mismatch error

Hello,

We're implementing OAuth2 authentication for our integration, but users are getting an error during the authorization step:

"Error: redirect_uri_mismatch
The redirect URI in the request does not match the registered redirect URIs"

Our redirect URI: https://app.connector.app/oauth/callback
Registered URI: https://app.connector.app/oauth/callback

They look identical to me. What's wrong?

Hi Stephanie,

I found the issue. In your OAuth application settings, the registered redirect URI is:

https://app.connector.app/oauth/callback/

Note the trailing slash. OAuth redirect URIs must match exactly, character for character. Either:

1. Update your registered URI to remove the trailing slash, OR
2. Update your application code to include the trailing slash

I recommend option 1. You can update this in:
Dashboard → Applications → OAuth Settings → Redirect URIs

Daniel,

Fixed! I removed the trailing slash and it's working now.

One more question: can we register multiple redirect URIs? We have separate staging and production environments.

Hi Stephanie,

Yes! You can register up to 10 redirect URIs per OAuth application. Just add each one on a separate line:

https://app.connector.app/oauth/callback
https://staging.connector.app/oauth/callback
http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback

Your application specifies which one to use in the authorization request via the redirect_uri parameter.

Note: We allow http://localhost for development, but all production URIs must use https.

Best,
Daniel
