Subject: Significant delay in data synchronization

Hi there,

We're seeing a 15-20 minute delay between when we create records via the API and when they appear in queries. This is causing major issues for our real-time inventory system.

Is there scheduled maintenance or an outage we should know about?

Hi Emma,

There's no outage on our end. I need to clarify how our API works:

- Write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) are immediately consistent
- However, our search/query API uses read replicas that sync every 15 minutes

If you need immediate read-after-write consistency, you should either:
1. Use the direct GET /items/{id} endpoint (always reads from primary)
2. Add the header "X-Read-Consistency: strong" to your queries (available on Pro tier+)

Are you currently using our search API for inventory lookups?

Best regards,

Tom,

Yes, we're using GET /items/search because we need to filter by multiple criteria. We're on the Standard tier currently.

Would upgrading to Pro solve this? What's the performance impact of strong consistency?

Hi Emma,

Strong consistency reads are typically 50-100ms slower than eventually consistent reads, but you get real-time data. For an inventory system, this is usually worth it.

Pro tier is $299/month and includes strong consistency mode plus higher rate limits.

Alternatively, if you're just checking stock for specific SKUs after updates, you could cache the item IDs from your write operations and use direct GET requests.

Let me know which direction works better for your use case.

Tom
